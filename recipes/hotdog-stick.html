    <h3>The new way to eat a wiener</h3>
    <p>
        I honestly don't like hot dogs that much, they are really
        great but it gets boring fast. Who east hot dogs twice
        a week? Not me. So eating a hot dog but on a stick, that is 
        interesting. Basically it is a weiner, or a sausage, covered
        in batter, then fried, all while being on a stick. My favourite
        weekend snack.
    </p>
    <p>
        These are popular all around the world, at least in latin America
        and Asia. They can get crazy, I mean you can add cheese cubes, 
        change the sausage for a shrimp, cover the batter in panko, add tiny
        cheese cubes on the batter, I tell you they are crazy. And that is 
        not even talking about the sauce, a whole universe opens. Yes the 
        classic way is with ketchup and mustard but the options are endless.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cups of flour</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp of salt</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp of suger</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>3/4 cup of milk</li>
        <li>A lot of oil to fry</li>
        <li>Sticks for hot dogs on a stick</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix all of the ingredients very well. Then let the batter chill for at least
            30 min in the fridge.
        </li>
        <li>Using a deep pan where you can fit your hot dogs, pour enough oil so they 
            float on it. Heat it at medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>Stab your sausages with the sticks.</li>
        <li>Pour the chilled batter on a glass, so that you can dump the sausages easily inside 
            the glass. This will make it very easy to cover them completely.
        </li>
        <li>Once the oil is hot, pour a tiny drop of the batter. If you see bubbles then is hot 
            enough. Place the sausages on the oil and wait a few seconds, when one side is golden 
            turn them. It helps to pour oil on the top with a spoon, it makes it fluff.
        </li>
        <li>Place them on a paper towel to absorb excess oil.</li>
        <li>Enjoy with your favourite sauce. Keep the sticks, they can be reused.</li>
        
    </ol>
