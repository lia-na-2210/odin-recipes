        <h3>The poor college student deligth</h3>
        <p>
            When I was in college money was a bit of a problem. 
            I had to make the most with what my parents sent me, 
            which meant saving money and eating things on sale even if 
            they were out of date. You have to do what you have to do. But 
            there was one recipe that I loved so much I still love to eat it, 
            even now when I still don't have money and still have to eat cheap.
            My beloved tuna salad.
        </p>
        <p>
            I never followed any recipe, just mixed what I had. A tuna can, 
            left over salad, and anything I found in my fridge. That is how this 
            baby was born. It is simple, maybe healthy, cheap, quick, and needs no 
            electronics (also had to save on electricity).
