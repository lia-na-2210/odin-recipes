        <h3>Easy+Microwave+Brownie=Lazy Dessert</h3>
        <p>Let's picture a scenario: 
            You have only 2 minutes to cook something and you crave 
            something sweet. You only have a few ingredients and a 
            microwave. Then why don't you try a delicious and easy
            mug brownie? It is foolproof and really only takes 2 minutes. 
            One for mixing the ingredients and one inside the microwave. 
            It might sound weird that you can cook a thing like this in the 
            microwave but it can be done, perfectly, it won't come out uncooked.
            But brownies are meant to "look not completely cooked" so keep that in mind. 
            
        </p>
        <p>
            You will need 9 ingredients, most likely you have at least 7 or 8. 
            If you don't you can buy them anywhere and, since you only use a tablespoon
            of each, it will last a long time. Which means brownies for a long time.
            Psycology says that chocolate tastes better in orange mugs, so maybe you 
            might need to buy one. I cook mine in my old, stained, a bit broken, 
            white Breaking Bad mug. The logo is almost gone and the brownies still taste
            really good. It's about chemistry, not about your feelings. It is sacred. You must respect
            the quemistry Jesse! So if you don't have an orange mug it's ok.
